•	Everyone is welcome! Steven, Matthew and I will Judge the solutions
•	Deadline is 12pm Monday 6/4
•	Solution must include RSpec tests
•	The solution must be in Ruby
•	Most points go to the most elegant, readable and tested solution (not necessarily the most verbose solution!)
•	I will dock points for unnecessary complexity
•	The more "rubyesque" the better (I.e. Ruby has its own 'syntactic sugar'. Use that as much as possible)
•	Only core ruby + spec is allowed. No rails or any other frameworks
•	I must be able to run the tests and application from my command line 
•	Solution must be placed in a public github repository, from which I will clone and evaluate. (A free github account is all you need).
•	Code must run without error, tests must pass 
•	I will not be answering questions about the problem. Covering all the requirements is part of this problem, therefor answering clarifying questions about them would be an unfair advantage. 
•	I will answer ruby syntax questions
•	Any rules that I forgot that are common sense ( :p ) 

Problem: 

SALES TAXES

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books,
food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional
sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no
exemptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the
items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the
items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.  The rounding rules for
sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains
(np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping
baskets...
